# Machine-Learning-Project

Today there are more than 1.15 million cases of breast cancer diagnosed worldwide annually. 
At present, only small number of accurate prognostic and predictive factors are used 
clinically for managing the patients with breast cancer. Early detection of this fatal disease is 
very important which helps in decreasing the morality rate and increasing the survival period 
of breast cancer patients. 


The project uses Mammography which is the main test used for screening and early 
diagnosis, and its analysis and processing are the keys to improving breast cancer prognosis. 
To detect breast cancer in mammogram, image segmentation is performed with the help of 
Fuzzy C-means (FCM) technique. Further those segmented regions features are extracted, 
and it is trained completely, finally trained images are classified by the efficient classifier of 
different classes in mammogram. Texture features are extracted using a feature extraction 
technique like Multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform, Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA), Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). 


Morphological operators are used to distinguish masses and microcalcifications from the 
background tissue and KNN algorithm is used for classification. The boundaries of tumour 
affected region in mammogram are marked and displayed to the doctor, along with area of 
tumour.
